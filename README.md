# Voice Cloning

Using RVC to clone Elon Musk's voice. This is an incomplete repository due to Colab removing RVC GUI and command-line inference giving errors.

## Approach

1. **Train RVC Model for Elon Musk's Voice**

2. **Run Inference for a Given Audio to Generate New Audio with Elon's Voice**

3. **BARK AI Integration**

   BARK AI can be used to convert text to audio, which can then be used for inference with the RVC model.
